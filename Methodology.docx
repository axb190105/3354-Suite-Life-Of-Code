For our project we are using the agile scrum methodology.

This is a project management system that relies on incremental development. 
Each iteration consists of two- to four-week sprints, 
where the goal of each sprint is to build the most important features first 
and come out with a potentially deliverable product

We decided to use the agile methodology because we are priorotizing the most important aspect of the
hotel management system first before before implementing the least important aspects. 
For example we would want to work on the Room Availability and booking system 
before implementing maintainance and Room Service.
